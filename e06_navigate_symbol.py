"""06: Navigate to Symbol

Navigate your project by code, not files.

- Navigate by code, not by files

- I want to get to the reduce_clutter func

- Navigate by Symbol (Shift-Ctrl-Alt-N Win/Linux, Alt-Cmd-O macOS)

    *** Shift-Ctrl-S -> Mine shortcut since it is easier for fingers:) ***

- Recent Files to get back

- Also goes into dependencies, e.g. `SerReg` or `wired.ServiceRegistry`

- As that shows, CamelHump also works
