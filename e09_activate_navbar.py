"""09: Activate Navigation Bar

Bring up the Navigation Bar as needed, let it disappear when finished.

- Now: Turn off Project tool window, go into full screen mode

- What if I need to *browse* files...but only *sometimes*?

- Alt-1/Cmd-1 to re-open Project Tool, then again to close? Nope.

- Jump to Navigation Bar (Alt-Home Win/Linux, Cmd-Up macOS)

- Hit ``Esc`` to dismiss
